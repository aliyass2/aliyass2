# Ali Yass

Backend .NET developer focused on building reliable, maintainable systems using **DDD**, **microservices**, and **event-driven architecture**, with a strong emphasis on **observability** and production readiness.

## What I do
- Design and implement backend APIs and services in **ASP.NET Core**
- Model business domains using **DDD** (aggregates, value objects, domain events)
- Build distributed workflows with **messaging** (e.g., RabbitMQ + MassTransit)
- Ship production-grade systems with **logging, metrics, tracing, and correlation**
- Own the “boring but critical” parts: resiliency, idempotency, outbox/inbox patterns, clean deployments

## Core stack
- **Language/Framework:** C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core
- **Architecture:** DDD, Clean Architecture, CQRS (MediatR), Microservices, EDA
- **Data:** EF Core, PostgreSQL, SQL Server
- **Messaging:** MassTransit, RabbitMQ
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry, Serilog, Seq, Grafana, Jaeger/Tempo/Prometheus (depending on setup)
- **Infra/DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Linux basics
- **Background jobs / realtime (as needed):** Hangfire, SignalR

## Public work (selected)
> Most of my professional work is in private company repositories.  
> I publish **sanitized demos** and **reproducible reference implementations** here to reflect how I build in production.

- **EVisaTicketSystem** — (short description: domain, patterns, key tech)  
- **Minicommerce / API demos** — (short description: domain, patterns, key tech)

Tip: replace the bullets above with your best 2–3 repos and keep each description to 1–2 lines.

## What I’m working on (high level)
- A multi-service system with **DDD boundaries**, **messaging**, and **end-to-end observability**
- Improving testing and deployment workflows for internal systems (CI/CD, migrations, reliability)

## Engineering principles I care about
- Clear boundaries > clever abstractions
- Traceability and debuggability are features
- Simple, explicit code that scales with teams
- Design for failure: retries, timeouts, idempotency, backpressure

If you’re hiring for backend/.NET roles, I’m happy to walk through architecture decisions, tradeoffs, and real production patterns (without exposing proprietary code).
